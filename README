This is the source code for my Barcamp Saigon 2011 talks on the Go
language and concurrency.

The HTML presentation is at http://aht.github.com/barcamp2011-gonuts/.

To make the HTML file, you'll need http://github.com/aht/nest/.

There are two sample Go programs:

* primitives.go:

    demonstrate Go's concurrency primitives

* echosrv.go:

    a short TCP echo server that spawn multiple goroutines,
    handle errors and also does logging!
